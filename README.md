## My Favorite Series are:
- **Bridgerton**: a drama set in Regency-era London, following the scandalous lives, romances, and intrigues of the aristocratic Bridgerton family, all while a mysterious gossip columnist, Lady Whistledown, unveils their secrets.
- **Pachinko**: a multigenerational family saga that spans across Japan, Korea, and the United States, following the struggles, dreams, and resilience of a Korean family as they navigate issues of identity, survival, and discrimination over several decades.
- **Maze Runner**: a dystopian sci-fi adventure where a group of teens, with no memory of their past, must navigate a deadly, ever-changing maze to escape a mysterious organization and uncover the truth behind their captivity.
